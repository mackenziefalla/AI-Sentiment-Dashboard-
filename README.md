## Project Overview
The **AI Sentiment Dashboard** is a web-based tool that analyzes user-entered text and classifies it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

Users can type any message into the text box and click **Analyze**.  
The dashboard instantly displays:

- The **predicted sentiment** (e.g., üòä Positive / üòê Neutral / ‚òπÔ∏è Negative)  
- **Probability scores** showing model confidence  
- A brief **Responsible AI notice** reminding users that predictions are educational, probabilistic, and privacy-safe  

This project was built for **Florida Atlantic University‚Äôs CAP 4630 ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence** course to demonstrate *responsible AI principles*, *machine-learning inference*, and *transparent design*.

## ü§ñ Responsible AI
We designed this project with **Responsible AI** principles in mind:

- **Biases:**  
  The model may reflect biases from its training data, especially around slang, cultural references, or underrepresented groups.

- **Limitations:**  
  Struggles with sarcasm, mixed emotions, or non-English text.  
  Does not provide advice, mood exercises, or next steps at this stage.

- **Data Privacy:**  
  No personal information is stored. The text is only processed to generate the sentiment label, probabilities, and emoji before being discarded.

- **Probabilities + Transparency:**  
  Probabilities show the model‚Äôs confidence (e.g., Positive: 70%, Neutral: 20%, Negative: 10%).  
  This makes the system more transparent and helps users interpret outputs responsibly.
