## Project Overview
Our project will be shaped as an AI sentiment dashboard that will be able to analyze text and read the type of tone. For example, the system can classify whether a message is positive, negative, or neutral. While it may not always be perfect, the goal is to give users helpful insights into how their words may be interpreted. We also hope this tool encourages people to reflect on their feelings and maybe use it as a step toward making life a little more comfortable.  

No personal data is stored on the platform. The AI dashboard only processes the text the user provides, generates the sentiment result, and displays it with an emoji. The system takes pride in its privacy services and we plan to make sure no user's information is able to get leaked.  

## Features


## Responsible AI 
We designed this project with responsible AI principles in mind:

-Biases :
The model may reflect biases from its training data, especially around slang, cultural references, or underrepresented groups.

-Limitations :
Struggles with sarcasm, mixed emotions, or non-English text.
Does not provide advice, mood exercises, or next steps at this stage.

-Data Privacy :
No personal information is stored. The text is only processed to generate the sentiment label, probabilities, and emoji before being discarded.

-Probabilities + Explanations for Transparency :
Probabilities show the model’s confidence (e.g., Positive: 70%, Neutral: 20%, Negative: 10%).
Explanations highlight which words/phrases influenced the result.
This makes the system more transparent and helps users interpret outputs responsibly.
